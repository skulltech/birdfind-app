Phew. Moved my whole studio/workspace through the house today.   We're finishing our basement.  I'm getting an ACTUAL office ‚Äî with real walls, not just sound-eating panels taped to the insulation.   Looking forward to designing a new studio from scratch! Here's the interim! https://t.co/bn8V0MKT25
499 customers paid more than $1, that one in six! 21 people paid more than 10 :D  Big thanks to everyone, no matter how much they paid.  What a birthday party that was :D
The "Hobbit sale" is over, and it went spectacularly.  Almost 3000 people bought my books, audiobooks, or course for $1+. In total, people paid $5052 for what would normally cost over $75k.

The Hobbit-style reverse gifting event has reached its midpoint.  Just 12 hours to go!  In the last 12 hours, 1754 friends have bought my books, audiobooks, or course for $1+.  What a blast. I did not expect this ‚Äî but I welcome it. Thanks, fellow hobbits ü•∞ Thank you so much! https://t.co/X918et6dTu https://t.co/8iznEGMSHz

18 hours to go on the Hobbit reverse-gifting event. I set the prices for all my products to $1+ 6 hours ago.  So far, 904 people took advantage of that, and $1.669 worth of products were bought. That's $1.85 paid on average ü§Ø  You're all way too kind :D What a birthday gift ü•∞ https://t.co/snpQGuSZoy https://t.co/8iznEGMSHz

A quick update, 2 hours into the 24-hour hobbit-reverse-gift-giving event where all my books &amp; courses cost $1 on @gumroad today:  ~250 sales so far, $404 altogether. Most people buy for $1, obviously, and some have paid $5 or even $15!  Very kind; I love you all just the same :D https://t.co/tF1irP5KlU https://t.co/8iznEGMSHz
There is an ongoing stream of these happening on my phone.  Best birthday celebration ever ü•∞ https://t.co/qiqIZExcDJ https://t.co/8iznEGNqx7

Let me take this opportunity to thank YOU for being here with me today. I am constantly blown away at the kind and empowering support I feel every single day on this platform. Thank you SO very much.
If you feel like gifting a copy of my work to a friend, partner, colleague, or your mortal nemesis, today is the day.   This is particularly nice if you have already read my books and gone through my course. No better way to pay it forward than getting people the full deal today.
That‚Äôs why I am making my work so incredibly affordable today ‚Äî and just today. You won‚Äôt see me do these things lightly. If at all, I do something around Black Friday, but that‚Äôs it.   But on my birthday, it‚Äôs gift-giving time, Hobbit-style.
I am a big Tolkien fan, and I love the tradition that the Hobbits have when their birthdays come around. Instead of asking for presents, they give their friends and family some! That means that everyone gets presents all year round. If only this was a thing in the real world.
Why am I doing this? Well, I know that many of my followers can‚Äôt afford or haven‚Äôt yet made up their minds about getting into my books and courses. Today, I want them to be able to.  Also, here‚Äôs me as a Hobbit, according to @midjourney.. Let me explain to you why that matters: https://t.co/tyiW3V94c8
This is my gift to you: for just today, my work, valued at $150+ at the very least, will be $5 if you buy everything at its minimum price. Two eBooks, two audiobooks, and an extensive course.  Of course, you can pay as much as you‚Äôd like, but that‚Äôs 100% up to you.
I turned 38 last week. As a LotR fan, I follow the Hobbit tradition &amp; GIVE gifts instead of getting them.  Here‚Äôs my birthday gift to YOU: for the next 24 hrs, my books &amp; course are "Pay What You Want", $1 minimum.  15.000+ copies sold; go check ‚Äòem out!  https://t.co/WdJ3f4v2Xo https://t.co/n4CfMABMSp
Feeling nervous about self-promotion as an indie entrepreneur? You're just a small fish in a vast online sea - focus on the value and benefits of your product and let that speak for itself. Who cares if they don't like you? You'll find your fellow nerds eventually.
Got a big surprise planned for tomorrow.

When you focus on helping people, making money becomes a natural consequence. It's a win-win situation.
Ha, it feels like I made this yesterday and my following here on Twitter is now in the mid 90k‚Äôs, less than half a year later.   I guess my Twitter growth tips might have some merit. Feel free to steal them. https://t.co/J5E6m3h2sL
Most people have a limit to how much they can take without feeling like they need to give something back. When you build in public, this is amplified even further. Don't be afraid to give freely and generously.
Bootstrapping a business requires being selective and strategic about where you allocate your resources. Don't waste time and money on things that aren't essential to your success.
If you have a SaaS that allows for it, do this kind of customer relationship nurturing. Tell people how they compare to their peers, where they excel, how well they do. @Grammarly does an amazing job at showing me why paying for their product is worth it ‚Äî and how ‚Äúsmart‚Äù I am ;) https://t.co/jFqlUoEYc1
Worst synonym for a thought leader in entrepreneurship:
Also, as AI art draws from existing and popular work, asking an artist to change their style is incredibly short-sighted.  Frustrating.
‚ÄúI don't believe you,‚Äù a moderator for r/art replied. ‚ÄúEven if you did ‚Äòpaint‚Äô it yourself, it's [‚Ä¶] obviously an Al-prompted design.

Success isn't a destination, it's a journey with many chapters.
Forget the myth of the solo indie entrepreneur - success is often a team effort. You might start out alone and be good with that for a while, but you'll sell yourself short if you don't set up your processes to be executed by other people.
Every interaction with a potential customer is an opportunity to refine your pitch. Talk to people about your work and see what resonates, then use those winning elements with your next prospect.
Do you have imposter syndrome?  Feel like you'll never be able to hire anyone? Struggling with low sales and high expectations?  These are just a few very common afflictions all founders eventually feel.  Check this out if you're looking for a way to deal with them. https://t.co/fM0FfGtFpp
If working from a keyboard ‚Äîon your own terms, to live a life that doesn‚Äôt require asking for permission‚Äî is for you, read this. https://t.co/FxSQpB013j
If you don't reach out and share your work with others, THAT will impact your business. Because you won't have one.
Marketing your product as an indie entrepreneur can be intimidating, especially if you don't like self-promotion. But remember, you're starting as an anonymous voice online to other anonymous users - who cares if they don't like you? It won't impact your life or business.
Facing a tough economy? Hang in there! If you can keep your business stable, you'll be in a prime position for success once the economy recovers.  You don't need massive growth goals right now.  What you need is a calm approach to keeping things stable.
If you struggle with mental health issues, please don't keep it to yourself. Involve health professionals, activate your support network, and engage with your founder peers who have been through this before.  You are most definitely not alone. ü•∞

Here are the issues we'll talk about today: https://t.co/clm1DMpIYW
Feeling down? Overwhelmed? You're not alone.  Entrepreneurship comes with challenges that can take a toll on mental health, such as burnout, overthinking, &amp; even addiction.   Let's talk about what can go wrong ‚Äî and how to stay clear of it.  https://t.co/R7RniWknzO

A very interesting lawsuit just popped up: @github (&amp; @OpenAI) are being sued over attribution questions in the(ir) Copilot coding assistant AI.  Claim: E.g., it presents CC-BY-licensed code but omits attribution requirements of the license.   Thoughts?  https://t.co/B5Ik6uhHeh
The entrepreneurial mindset isn't something you inherit at birth. It's something you can actively cultivate and grow within yourself.
Be cautious of those who try to steer you away from entrepreneurship. They may have a self-serving interest in seeing you pursue their dreams instead of your own.
In a world where everyone is talking, people are drawn to the one who's listening.
Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, but that doesn't mean you can't give it a try. Don't let fear hold you back from exploring your potential.
If your business can, at the very least, plateau during this looming recession, you'll be doing amazing once things trend upward again.

When you build a bootstrapped SaaS, your anxiety is about keeping the lights on. When you sell that business for $200mil, another, much more potent anxiety creeps into your life.   Here's @patticus sharing his wild ride throughout and beyond the acquisition of ProfitWell. https://t.co/HhLX0G7YNH
And as usual, I have my own opinion on this :D  https://t.co/3BEFYvPAed
@mhmazur I was talking to @mjwhansen about just this topic a few months ago!  https://t.co/IdtJdnoEeI
If you feel like you should go full-time on your side project, but it's not the right time, it might help you to know that @mhmazur took 13 years to do this with his SaaS.  Take your time.  https://t.co/qSAHYlWTA9

I guess @Patticus walking 31 miles on a treadmill to deal with his anxiety after selling a business for $200 million is one of the more surprising anecdotes from his journey.

A few things that stand out in this interview:  - Pat is extremely open about the mental health challenges he faced (and is still facing) - Gigantic acquisitions are scary - Imposter syndrome hits people who sell for $200mil
I'm excited to speak with @patticus, founder of @ProfitWell, which recently sold for $200m to @Paddle. We discuss Patrick's experience with the acquisition, the future of the online payment industry, &amp; the importance of mental health in entrepreneurship.  https://t.co/G1kpYS3hvk

Realistic building in public for introverted founders doesn't have to happen all at once.  It can't happen overnight.  Trust is slowly built and quickly lost.
ü•∞ https://t.co/8Kd4sRQ7N9
You don't have to go full-time on your idea to "build a real business."   In fact, having "many small bets" is a much less risky approach.
The best tech stack is the one you already know.
Self-promotion doesn't have to be selfish.  "I made this for you" is much better than "Look at me, I made this."  Always contextualize your work for those you want to serve and empower.
One thing I love about being a writer that gets mail from his readers is that I get to see the process of how people apply my work.  It's mind-blowing to think that something I wrote motivated this person to REALLY reflect on their entrepreneurial present &amp; future. So grateful! https://t.co/r2S8wRmRyP

Many of us tend to hunker down and focus on our products or projects, often to the exclusion of building an audience or engaging with potential customers or clients.  But sharing your work and process in public has many benefits!
Some days I just can‚Äôt believe that I get to do what I do.
What do you think: should bootstrappers consider using Lifetime Deals to raise some initial capital directly from their customers?  If you have an opinion or experiences, please help this fellow founder here:  https://t.co/lV9CJaquSv
Monetization on YouTube was never really a goal for me when I started out, but I am pretty happy that I'm halfway there!  More than ad revenue (which I likely won't go for now that sponsors have been reaching out), I'm excited to get access to better analytics and tooling. https://t.co/LdhlTKxM5F
Building a business is a serious pursuit, not a game. Don't get caught up in the startup lifestyle and lose sight of what's really important.
If you want to create a sustainable business, focus on solving problems that save people time, money, or even earn them money. It's a recipe for success.

If you're an introverted founder, don't worry!  One way to build a community and get feedback is to engage with your audience and respond to their tweets, comments, and questions.  I call this the audience audition!
First come, first serve. Also: this will be my birthday episode.  So... get creative :D
